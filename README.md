# IntuiTek-MosaicEngine System Manifest & Operational Directive

**This document is the central system directive for the IntuiTek-MosaicEngine. It defines the architecture, provides operational commands, and serves as the comprehensive manifest that directly enmeshes Operator's capabilities with the repository’s functions.**

---

## 1. System Overview

The **IntuiTek-MosaicEngine** is an AI-driven execution platform that transforms high-level concept blueprints into a fully operational, modular system. It comprises the following core layers:

- **Concept Ingestion:** Uses an LLM (via the OpenAI API) to parse natural language blueprints into structured JSON.
- **Module Mapping:** Utilizes AI to select and map each extracted component to the best-fit software modules.
- **Registry & Integration:** Maintains a centralized YAML registry that defines module endpoints and JSON schemas.
- **Orchestration:** Leverages a containerized, Flask-based system to coordinate and execute the mapped modules.
- **Monitoring & Self-Healing:** Implements logging and periodic health checks to ensure continuous system performance.
- **Operator Toolbox:** Provides a curated list of web-based resources and additional tools for extended functionality.

## 2. System Directive for Operator

**Operator, upon ingesting this file, please execute the following commands sequentially to fully activate the repository:**

1. **Ingest the System Blueprint:**
   - **Action:** Read the `sample_concept.txt` file and invoke the ingestion process.
   - **How:**
     - **API Method:** Send a POST request to the `/ingest` endpoint with the concept text.
     - **CLI Method:** Run:
       ```bash
       python ingestion/cli_ingest.py sample_concept.txt
       ```
   - **Outcome:** A structured JSON file (`output_concept.json`) is generated that details modules, databases, interfaces, and workflows.

2. **Map and Select System Components:**
   - **Action:** Use the mapping module to convert the structured concept into a candidate module mapping.
   - **How:** Process the `output_concept.json` through the mapping module.
   - **Outcome:** A file (`module_mapping.json`) is produced that links each abstract module (e.g., "task_manager", "client_crm") with a concrete implementation.

3. **Load the Registry Manifest:**
   - **Action:** Verify that the registry (`registry/registry.yaml`) accurately defines the endpoints and data schemas for each module.
   - **How:** Confirm that all modules are configured for interoperability.
   - **Outcome:** The system has a clear, standardized interface for each component.

4. **Orchestrate the Execution Pipeline:**
   - **Action:** Trigger the orchestration layer to execute the full workflow.
   - **How:**
     - **API Method:** Send a POST request to the `/mosaic` endpoint with the appropriate payload.
   - **Outcome:** The orchestration layer iterates through the registry, calling each module (with built-in retries) and aggregates the results.

5. **Engage Continuous Monitoring:**
   - **Action:** Initiate and monitor system health.
   - **How:**
     - Query the monitoring endpoints or check logs to confirm that each component is responsive.
     - Optionally, use a web dashboard or API endpoint for real-time system status.
   - **Outcome:** Operator can observe system performance and trigger self-healing mechanisms if needed.

6. **Utilize the Operator Toolbox:**
   - **Action:** Refer to the toolbox resources provided in `toolbox/operator_toolbox.md` and `toolbox/resources.md`.
   - **How:** Use these links to access external tools such as GitHub, Docker Hub, online IDEs, and API testing tools.
   - **Outcome:** Operator has all the necessary external resources to supplement and troubleshoot the system.

## 3. Operational Commands & Entry Points

**API Endpoints:**

- **`/ingest`:**
  - **Purpose:** Accepts high-level concept text and returns a structured blueprint.
  - **Usage Example (via HTTP POST):**
    ```json
    {
      "concept_text": "Your detailed blueprint here..."
    }
    ```
- **`/mosaic`:**
  - **Purpose:** Receives an execution payload and orchestrates calls to all modules as defined in the registry.
  - **Usage Example (via HTTP POST):**
    ```json
    {
      "sample": "data",
      "additional_parameters": "..."
    }
    ```

**CLI Entry Point:**

- **Ingestion CLI:**
  - **Command:**
    ```bash
    python ingestion/cli_ingest.py sample_concept.txt
    ```
  - **Purpose:** Directly triggers concept ingestion from a local file.

## 4. Setup and Deployment

Before executing any commands, ensure that:

- All dependencies are installed using each folder’s `requirements.txt`.
- API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are set in the environment.
- The system is deployed via Docker Compose:
  ```bash
  cd orchestration
  docker-compose up --build

    The orchestration service and all modules (e.g., task_manager, client_crm) are running and accessible as defined in registry/registry.yaml.

5. Future Enhancements and Best Practices

    Advanced Monitoring:
    Integrate with Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and Grafana for deeper system metrics and alerts.
    Robust Security:
    Use environment variables and secret management tools for API keys and sensitive data.
    Scalability:
    Implement caching (e.g., via Redis) and circuit breaker patterns to ensure system resilience under load.
    Automated Feedback:
    Continuously improve the system by feeding monitoring data back into the orchestration layer to adjust performance.

6. Final System Manifest

Operator, this README.md file is your primary system directive. Upon ingestion, execute the above steps to seamlessly connect to and control the IntuiTek-MosaicEngine. Follow these directives to:

    Transform abstract blueprints into structured, executable tasks.
    Map and standardize software components.
    Deploy, orchestrate, and monitor the entire system.
    Leverage external resources for troubleshooting and extended functionality.

Execute and Report:

    Start by ingesting the concept blueprint.
    Map and load all modules.
    Trigger orchestration and confirm integrated execution.
    Monitor system health continuously.
    Use the toolbox for any additional resources or troubleshooting.

Happy executing and building!
