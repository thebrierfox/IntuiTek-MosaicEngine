# IntuiTek-MosaicEngine

The **IntuiTek-MosaicEngine** is an AI-driven system designed to take high-level concept blueprints, analyze and break them down into modular components, and then orchestrate the deployment, integration, and continuous monitoring of those modules.

## Key Features
- **Concept Ingestion:** Uses an LLM to parse natural language blueprints into structured JSON.
- **Module Mapping:** AI-driven search and selection of open-source or internal modules.
- **Registry & Integration:** Centralized YAML/JSON registry that defines module endpoints and I/O schemas.
- **Orchestration:** Containerized deployment via Docker Compose/Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Monitoring & Self-Healing:** AI-driven logging and performance monitoring with automated adjustments.
- **Operator Toolbox:** A curated list of web-based resources that Operator leverages to execute tasks.

## Folder Structure
- **ingestion/**: Scripts for concept ingestion and analysis.
- **mapping/**: Code for AI-driven module mapping and evaluation.
- **registry/**: Component registries in JSON/YAML format.
